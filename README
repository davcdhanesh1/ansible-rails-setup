Hey hi, 

Before setting up this box, 
You need to follow few steps to prove that you are cool enough.
  
  1. Install Ansible on your local box.
  2. Install vagrant and VirtualBox.
 
How to create base vagrant box:
  1. You better grab basic vagrant documentation. It is very easy. Even a stupid like Dhanesh could do it with ease.
  2. For basebox image, use this link: https://vagrantcloud.com/ubuntu/boxes/trusty64/versions/14.04/providers/virtualbox.box
  3. set an environment variable 'vagrant_base_box_url' pointing towards the local path where you have downloaded vagrant box
   
How to provision box using ansible code:
  
  1. cd /ansible-infra
  2. ansible-playbook -k site.yaml -i hosts ( -k is ask-password option, use it only if your provisioning particular box first time in your life,
                                              to setup SSH key authorization 
                                              -i is to specify Inventory (Ansible concept) i.e. hosts )

  3. When you will run this command, You will be asked for password. Enter your guest box's password. In this case it will be 'vagrant'
     provided that you have setup you default box with Vagrantfile from the source.
  4. That's it your good to go.

What Magic will this box do:
  1. For that go and see infra code yourself.

### Warnings ###
  1. Lots of places have hardcoded values so please don't touch them unless you know what you are doing. And I sure you it.


### How To Run: A six step process ###

 1. Everything is set up for you after this, Just got to vagrant box and clone the Rails code in your home directory in application folder. ( i.e. in /home/vagrant )
    Like this "git clone <repo-url> application".
 
 2. After this run cd into 'application' directory. 
    run, "bundle install --path vendor/bundle"
 
 3. After this in the same directory,
    run, "bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate db:seed db:test:prepare"
    (For this to run correctly make sure that, in your application's database.yml file you have, username: development and password: password for development environment ) 

 4. Then ,
    run sudo service nginx restart
 
 5. Try to hit the application's url from host browser like this "127.0.0.1:8080".

 6. Well there is not step 6.
