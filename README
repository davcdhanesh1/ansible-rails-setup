Hey hi, 

Before setting up this box, 
You need to follow few steps to prove that you are cool enough.
  
  1. Install Ansible on your local box.
  2. Install vagrant and VirtualBox.
 
How to create base vagrant box:
  1. You better grab basic vagrant documentation. It is very easy. Even a stupid like Dhanesh could do it with ease.
   
How to provision box using ansible code:
  
  1. cd /ansible-infra
  2. ansible-playbook -k site.yaml ( -k is ask-password option, use it only if your provisioning particular box first time in your life,
                                      to setup SSH key authorization )
  3. When you will run this command, You will be asked for password. Enter your guest box's password. In this case it will be 'vagrant'
     provided that you have setup you default box with Vagrantfile from the source.
  4. That's it your good to go.

What Magic will this box do:
  1. For that go and see infra code yourself.
